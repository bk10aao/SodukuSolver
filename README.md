#Soduku Solver

This project will solve a soduku based off of a 2d array.

An example, as in the code for a valid puzzle:

``int[][] board =  { {7, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0}, 
                  {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0},
                  {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0},
                  {8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0},
                  {0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0},
                  {0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8},
                  {0, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5},
                  {0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                  {0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3} }; ``
                      

And for an invalid puzzle:

``int[][] unsolvableBoard =      { {7, 7, 2, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0},
                                    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0},
                                    {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0},
                                    {8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0},
                                    {0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0},
                                    {0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8},
                                    {0, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5},
                                    {0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                                    {0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3} }; ``
