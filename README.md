#Soduku Solver

This project will solve a soduku based off of a 2d array.

An example, as in the code for a valid puzzle:

``` 
     int[][] board =              { {7, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 0},
                                    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0},
                                    {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0},
                                    {8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0},
                                    {0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0},
                                    {0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8},
                                    {0, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5},
                                    {0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                                    {0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3} };                  
```

Returns: 

```
                                          732 | 458 | 619
                                          956 | 173 | 824
                                          184 | 629 | 537
                                          --- + --- +---
                                          871 | 564 | 392
                                          643 | 892 | 751
                                          295 | 317 | 468
                                          --- + --- +---
                                          329 | 786 | 145
                                          418 | 235 | 976
                                          567 | 941 | 283
```
And for an invalid puzzle:

```
     int[][] unsolvableBoard =    { {5, 1, 6, 8, 4, 9, 7, 3, 2},
                                    {3, 0, 7, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0},
                                    {8, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5},
                                    {1, 3, 5, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 7},
                                    {4, 7, 2, 5, 9, 1, 0, 0, 6},
                                    {9, 6, 8, 3, 7, 0, 0, 5, 8},
                                    {2, 5, 3, 1, 8, 6, 0, 7, 4},
                                    {6, 8, 4, 2, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0},
                                    {7, 9, 1, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 8} }; 
```
